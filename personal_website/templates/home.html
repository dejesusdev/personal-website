        <p>
            Hi, I’m making the leap from a career in construction 
            to the exciting world of information technology and 
            programming. My passion for building and creating is what 
            first drew me to construction, where I learned the value of 
            project management, problem-solving, and paying close attention 
            to detail. Those experiences gave me a strong foundation—and now 
            I’m channeling that same drive into tech. I’m diving into 
            coding and software development with the goal of building creative, 
            functional digital solutions, just like I once built and improved 
            physical spaces. It’s a big shift, but it feels like the natural next step.
        </p>
